The ATM application is a command-line interface (CLI) program designed to simulate the functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Developed using TypeScript with Node.js and Inquirer.js, this application provides users with a seamless banking experience, allowing them to perform various transactions conveniently from their computer.
Features:

User Authentication: The ATM application ensures secure access to banking services by requiring users to authenticate themselves using a username and PIN combination.

Balance Inquiry: Users can check their account balance at any time to view their available funds.

Cash Withdrawal: The application allows users to withdraw cash from their account, with options to select the withdrawal amount based on available balance and denominations.

Deposit Funds: Users can deposit funds into their account by specifying the amount they wish to deposit.

Transfer Funds: The application facilitates fund transfers between accounts, enabling users to send money to other registered accounts.

Implementation Details:

TypeScript: The application is developed using TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and scalability.

Node.js: Node.js is utilized as the runtime environment for executing the TypeScript code. It provides access to the file system and enables server-side scripting for building robust CLI applications.

Inquirer.js: Inquirer.js is integrated to create interactive command-line interfaces, allowing users to input data and make selections through a series of prompts.
